# Mock Interview Platform
This app was designed to help both aspiring and current programmers improve their technical coding skills by pairing two users to perform a mock interview with each other. Once the interview has finished, both users will provide feedback for the other user on their strengths and weaknesses.
  
Try out the application at [mock-interview-platform.herokuapp.com](https://mock-interview-platform.herokuapp.com/)!

* [Mongo DB/Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/) - Database used to store our user and application data.
* [Socket.IO](https://socket.io/) - JavaScript library for creating real-time lobby and interview rooms.
* [Glot](https://glot.io/) - API used to run code from the code editor.

## Features:
* User login/sign up authentication.
* Randomly selected interview questions based on the user's current skill level.
* Real-time code change updates on screen.

## Installation:
If you want to run the application locally, follow the instructions below:
1. Clone repository
2. Install Dependencies - Run ```npm install``` in the root directory and client directory
3. Create a file with the name ```.env```
4. Add the application secret key for authentication using ```SECRET_KEY``` to ```.env```
5. Add the application mongo uri ```MONGO_LOCAL_URI``` to ```.env```. Additional information to run mongoDB locally can be found [here](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/installation/). Alternatively you can use Mongo Atlas [here](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas).
6. To run code from the code editor, create an account on [glot.io](https://glot.io/). You can find your api key after registering [here](https://glot.io/account/token). Add glot token ```GLOT_TOKEN``` to ```.env```.
7. Sign up for [AWS S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/) and add ```S3_ACCESS_KEY```, ```S3_ACCESS_SECRET``` and ```S3_BUCKET_NAME``` to ```.env```
8. Final ```.env``` appear should like below: 
```
SECRET_KEY=<Secret key for passport.js>
MONGO_LOCAL_URI=<Your mongo uri>
GLOT_TOKEN="Token <Your glot token>"
S3_ACCESS_KEY=<Your S3 access key>
S3_ACCESS_SECRET=<Your S3 secret>
S3_BUCKET_NAME=<Your bucket name>
```
9. Run ```npm run dev``` to start the server on the root directory and ```npm start``` on client to start the application
