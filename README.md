# Mock Interview Platform
This app was designed to help both aspiring and current programmers improve their technical coding skills by pairing two users to perform a mock interview with each other. Once the interview has finished, both users will provide feedback for the other user on their strengths and weaknesses. 
<br><br>
Features include: 
* User login/sign up authentication.
* Randomly selected interview questions based on the user's current skill level.
* Real-time code change updates on screen.
* Two-way video chat functionality using WebRTC.
* Upcoming/past practice interview dashboard for easy user experience.
